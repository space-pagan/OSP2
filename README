Compilation:
	The Makefile for this project will create the following:
		bin/master
		bin/palin
	
		The default recipe 'make' will build both of these executables.
		'make clean' will delete obj/ and bin/, including all files within
		'make cleanrun' will delete bin/*.out and bin/*.log

Running the program:
	master [-n N] [-s S] [-t T] [-h] FILE
		-n N	Sets the maximum number of non-blank lines to process from FILE,
					defaults to 4

		-s S	Sets the maximum number of concurrent child processes.
					defaults to 2, Hard-limited to 20

		-t T	Sets the timeout period. After T seconds have passed, master
					and all child processes will be terminated.
					defaults to 100

Version Control:
	This project's version control has been managed under git. For a log of
	modifications, use 'git log', and its various options.

Outstanding Problems:
	None, to my knowledge.

Encountered Difficulties:
	The only major issues have been setting up shared memory, as it took me
	some time to realize that it is very difficult to create a two-dimensional
	shared memory object. Additionally, I ran into issues storing stream
	objects in a vector due to a bug in gcc 4.8.5, even though this behaviour
	is legal and defined by the C++11 standard.

Bugtesting efforts:
	Multiple test files (tests/*.test) with varied behaviour
	Manual early termination of master with ^C
	Automated early termination of master with -t
	Various combinations of CLI arguments to test CLI Parsing
	Giving invalid names for FILE
	removing palin from bin/ directory

	Everything appears to work without issue.
